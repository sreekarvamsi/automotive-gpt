This defect can cause sticky steering, which was first reported in a confirmed complaint on September 9, 2021. The issue was significant enough to prompt an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which began with a Preliminary Evaluation and was later upgraded to an Engineering Analysis to further investigate the reports of sticky steering. The problem with the steering gear box assembly was linked to the manufacturing process of the worm wheel, which was later revised to address the deformation issue [Source 3, Page 6].",

        "answer": "To determine the towing capacity of a 2021 Ford F-150, you need to calculate the maximum loaded trailer weight for your specific vehicle configuration. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Start with the Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR) for your vehicle model and axle ratio. This information can be found in the vehicle's manual or by consulting an authorized dealer.\n2. Subtract the following weights from the GCWR to find the maximum loaded trailer weight:\n   - Vehicle curb weight.\n   - Hitch hardware weight (e.g., draw bar, ball, locks, or weight distributing hardware).\n   - Driver weight.\n   - Passenger weight.\n   - Payload, cargo, and luggage weight.\n   - Aftermarket equipment weight.\n\nThe result from these calculations will give you the maximum loaded trailer weight that your 2021 Ford F-150 can tow. Note that the trailer tongue load should be considered part of the vehicle's payload and should be subtracted from the total payload.\n\nFor specific towing capacity values and additional guidance, refer to the RV and Trailer Towing Guide available online at Ford's official fleet website or consult an authorized Ford dealer [Source 1, Page 433; Source 2, Page 417].",

        "answer": "The provided context does not explicitly list the warning signs of the Honda Civic steering defect. However, it mentions investigations into reports of \"sticky steering\" in the affected vehicles [Source 1, Page 6]. This term typically refers to a condition where the steering feels notchy or has increased resistance when turning the steering wheel. If you need information on specific symptoms or warning signs, I recommend consulting the vehicle's owner manual or contacting a Honda service center for more detailed guidance.",
